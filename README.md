# A web-based Dockerfile Generator

Generator that assists users in creating Dockerfiles or Docker Compose configurations tailored to their specific project requirements. The generator will ask users a series of questions about their project, and based on their responses, it will generate the necessary Dockerfile(s) or Docker Compose YAML.

## Key Features

User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for users to input project details.

Project Information: Gather project-specific information, such as the programming language, framework, database, and any additional services or dependencies.

Multi-Stage Builds: Implement support for multi-stage Docker builds to optimize image size and build efficiency.

Dependency Management: Ask users if their project requires specific dependencies or libraries and include them in the generated Dockerfile(s).

Environment Variables: Allow users to set environment variables required for their application within the Dockerfile or Docker Compose YAML.
    
Port Configuration: Enable users to specify which ports should be exposed by the container.

Volume Mounts: Provide an option to specify volume mounts for data persistence, if applicable.

Networking Configuration: Offer network configuration options, including bridge, host, or user-defined networks.

Output Generation: Generate the Dockerfile or Docker Compose YAML based on the user's inputs.

Code Snippet Preview: Display a preview of the generated Dockerfile(s) or Docker Compose YAML, allowing users to review and copy the code.

Resources for Developers: What is Docker, Videos, Descriptions, How to?
